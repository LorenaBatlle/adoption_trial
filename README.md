## Introduction

This project has the purpose of showing some of my hard and comms skills. It gives a big picture about how I achieve some insights, it is not looking for the best performance or a complete project process.


## Main problem goal

The main goal is to extract insights and predict if a user would become a paying customer or not at the end of a trial.

## Context

There is an app which offers a monthly subscription with one week trial period, at the end of which, the customer starts paying the subscription, unless they cancel.

The journey starts with installing the app on a user's device. When a user launches the app for the first time he needs to complete the onboarding info. Right after, a paywall is shown. This is where the app gives the chance to start a subscription with the mentioned 7 days trial period. After 7 days - and if they donâ€™t cancel their subscription - they become paying customers and an invoice is recorded in the system.

The company is interested in knowing if a user would potentially convert into a customer after trial ends. Besides, knowing it as soon as possible in the trial period gives them some advantage to take other actions.


## Data provided

Users who started trial during December 2020.
